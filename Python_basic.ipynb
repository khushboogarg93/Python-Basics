        "   - Python is a Popular Programming Language developed in 1991 by Guido Van Rossam.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Used to give instructions to Computer or Machine\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It is like a set of special rules and symbols that you use to give instructions to a machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - In simple terms, like in real life when two persons talk to each other and use the same language medium like english or hindi they can easily talk without any problem but when 1 person knows Hindi and other knows spanish then its difficult to talk and understand each other for that we need some translator who can translates their talks and make them understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Simillarly, when human wants to communicate with machine or computer they need something in between who can translate their talks.\n",

        "   - Machines only understand binary language (0 or 1) and Humans simple language.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - So for to make them understand we have something in between i.e. IDE (Integrated development enviornment) where you can write the code using any programming language like python.\n",

        "   - Pre defined keywords in python is something reserved words which having the special meaning that are part of python syntax and cannot be used as identifiers like in variable names and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Its meaning can not be changed its fixed and if you try to do that it will come up with lot of problems like suppose if we used print as a variable print = \"abc\" then it will not give any exception because then python will understand its a variable but next time when you try to print like print(\"hello\") it will throw the exception\n",
        "\n",
        "   - And to prevent this problem then you have restrat the kernel.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - There are many but few are commonly used like\n",
        "      1. type() => it is used to check the type of any variable for ex : x = \"Khushboo\" type(x) will result as str simmillary we can identify any of variable data type whether it is integer, boolean, float, string, complex etc.\n",

        "   - Yes we can but its not recommended and not a good practice to use. Although it will not throw any exception when you use them as a variable but later on when you use them for further process it will be modified and throw exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Then in that case we have only 1 choice left to restart the kernel.\n",
